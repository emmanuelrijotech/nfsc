Introductory Paragraph

Smart DFIR Hunt is a Linux investigation helper designed to make security triage easier for everyone
from students to experienced responders. Instead of guessing, the script automatically collects important 
information about running processes, network connections, startup mechanisms, authentication modules, and 
other common places attackers like to hide. 

It organizes everything into readable report files so a human (or an AI assistant) 
can review what is normal and what might require attention.

Under the hood, the script runs trusted system commands, gathers evidence, applies simple risk logic, 
and then saves the results into a structured folder created in the same directory from where you launched it. 
Think of it as taking a full diagnostic snapshot of the machine at a specific moment in time.

Because the script is executed with sudo/root privileges, the output files are also owned by root. 
Before uploading them to an AI or sharing them with someone else, you may need to change the permissions so 
your normal user account can read them. Once accessible, those files can be interpreted manually or used with 
AI prompts to speed up the investigation.

🎯 Pro tip (makes answers MUCH better)
*********************************************
Instead of uploading everything, start with:
summary.txt
network_pid_intel.txt
temp_execution_findings.txt
hidden_socket_findings.txt
systemd_execstart_review.txt
cron_suspicious_grep.txt
security_modules_dpkg_ownership.txt
dpkg_integrity_report.txt
*********************************************
These contain 90% of signal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🧠 Even more advanced version (correlation focused)
If you want deep linking between process ancestry and network:
Prioritize mapping:
***************************************************************
parent → child → executable → package → listener → persistence

If a process has:
- unusual path
- no package owner
- network activity
- persistence reference

elevate its severity.

🧠 What elite teams actually do
They use AI to:

✔ shrink 2 hours into 10 minutes
✔ validate intuition
✔ catch what humans miss
✔ document logic
✔ generate next steps

Exactly what we are doing here.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) How humans read these reports (practical workflow)

Step A — Start with summary.txt
This is your “table of contents + verdict hint”.
Risk Score: tells you if the script saw multiple red flags.
Top Findings: the highest-impact issues the script scored.
Key sysctl flags: tells you if routing/forwarding settings are risky.
Public listeners: quick view of ports bound to 0.0.0.0 / ::.
Goal: decide fast: normal, review, or investigate now.

Step B — Confirm network reality

Open these next:
ss_tulnp.txt and ss_tunap.txt → what’s listening / connecting and which PID owns it
network_pid_intel.txt → the script’s normalized table: 
PID, user, EXE path, dpkg ownership, cmdline

What you’re looking for:
Unknown processes holding sockets
Weird execution paths (/tmp, /dev/shm, /home/...)
No package ownership (binary not belonging to installed packages)

Step C — Check “stealth indicators”

These are the “if this hits, pay attention” files:
temp_execution_findings.txt → running from temp paths or deleted executables
hidden_socket_findings.txt → sockets seen in /proc/net/* but missing from ss -e view
socket_inodes_unmapped.txt → inodes that couldn’t be tied to a PID 
(can be normal, but suspicious if it aligns with other red flags)

Goal: catch “I’m hiding from normal tools” behavior.

Step D — Persistence review (how would it come back?)

systemd_execstart_review.txt + systemd_enabled_services.txt
cron_suspicious_grep.txt + cron dumps
authorized_keys_all_users.txt
polkit_rules.txt, sudoers.txt
ld_so_preload.txt and ld_preload_env_grep.txt
systemd_generators_inventory.txt
udev_suspicious_grep.txt
security_modules_dpkg_ownership.txt

What you’re looking for:
Autostarts that run scripts from unusual places
Hidden auth access via SSH keys
PAM/NSS or preload tricks (high severity)

Step E — Integrity & tampering check

dpkg_integrity_report.txt
This helps answer: “Does anything installed look modified?”

Step F — Only if relevant: containers / eBPF / namespaces
docker_ps.txt, crictl_ps.txt
bpftool_* outputs (if installed)
lsns_net.txt, ip_netns.txt

This is where lab systems often show noise, hence the PROFILE toggle.

2) AI Prompt (Plug-and-Play) to Analyze the Bundle & Detect Intrusion

Copy and paste this into the AI tool you want to use.
It is tailored specifically for smart_dfir_hunt_v3.sh.

Master Prompt (Full DFIR Investigation)
Act as a senior DFIR / SOC analyst.

You are going to analyze the output of a Linux triage script named smart_dfir_hunt_v3.sh.

Your mission is NOT to assume compromise.
Your mission is to evaluate evidence and identify what deserves human attention.

RULES:
1) Do not invent. If there is no explicit evidence in the logs, say so.
2) For each finding provide:
   - Finding
   - Evidence (file name and lines when possible)
   - Impact
   - Likelihood
   - Recommended next step
3) Prioritize severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low.
4) Separate strong indicators from possible false positives.
5) If evidence is insufficient, tell me which extra command you would run.

SCRIPT CONTEXT:
- The script generates a folder forensic_hunt_TIMESTAMP.
- It contains host, network, process, firewall, sysctl, persistence, eBPF,
  udev, PAM/NSS, namespaces, hidden socket, docker/crictl, and summary data.
- A risk score and Top Findings already exist.
- PROFILE may be endpoint or lab.
  Endpoint = less tolerance for noise.
  Lab = containers, namespaces, and experiments may be normal.

OUTPUT I EXPECT FROM YOU:
A) Executive summary (5–10 lines): normal / review / investigate now.
B) Top 10 findings ordered by severity.
C) Approximate timeline if clues exist.
D) Suspicious processes (PID, user, exe path, cmdline, ports, reason).
E) Persistence vectors discovered.
F) Stealth indicators.
G) Concrete verification commands and what we should expect.
H) If rootkit/eBPF manipulation is suspected, be cautious and suggest validation.

FILES TO PRIORITIZE:
1) summary.txt
2) network_pid_intel.txt
3) ss_tulnp.txt, ss_tunap.txt
4) temp_execution_findings.txt
5) hidden_socket_findings.txt + socket_inode_to_pid.txt + socket_inodes_unmapped.txt
6) systemd_execstart_review.txt + enabled services/timers
7) cron_suspicious_grep.txt
8) authorized_keys_all_users.txt
9) polkit_rules.txt + sudoers.txt
10) ld_so_preload.txt + ld_preload_env_grep.txt
11) dpkg_integrity_report.txt
12) systemd_generators_inventory.txt
13) udev_suspicious_grep.txt
14) security_modules_dpkg_ownership.txt
15) bpftool outputs if present
16) lsns_net.txt + ip_netns.txt

ANALYSIS GUIDANCE:

Treat as HIGH RISK:
- Executables running from /tmp, /var/tmp, /dev/shm
- "(deleted)" executables
- sockets present in /proc but missing in ss
- non-empty /etc/ld.so.preload
- enabled systemd services executing from unusual paths
- udev RUN+= with curl/wget/nc/socat
- PAM/NSS modules without dpkg ownership
- integrity mismatches in binaries/libraries

Treat as POSSIBLY NORMAL depending on context:
- multiple namespaces on container hosts
- bpffs mounted
- public listeners for known services like ssh

Start with summary.txt, then correlate across the rest.
Quick Prompt (Fast triage – yes/no)
Analyze these smart_dfir_hunt_v3.sh results like a DFIR analyst.

Tell me:
1) Are there clear signs of compromise or persistence? Why?
2) Top 5 findings with exact evidence.
3) 5 verification commands to confirm or dismiss.

If evidence is missing, say uncertain.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why this prompt works

It forces AI to:
✅ stay evidence based
✅ avoid paranoia
✅ correlate data
✅ explain reasoning
✅ give next actions
✅ distinguish signal vs noise

Exactly how real SOC / IR teams operate.

3) How to Sanitize / Redact Logs Before Uploading to AI

Your bundle may contain:

internal IP ranges

usernames

hostnames

domain names

SSH keys

file paths

tokens in command lines

proxy info

DNS servers

Even if the AI is trustworthy, you should practice minimum disclosure.

🎯 Goal

Keep:

✅ behavior
✅ anomalies
✅ relationships
✅ paths style
✅ service names

Remove or mask:

❌ sensitive identity data
❌ infrastructure details

🧠 What usually needs masking
High sensitivity

authorized_keys

tokens in command lines

internal IP addresses

VPN endpoints

hostnames

email addresses

Medium

usernames

home directories

Usually safe

package names

process names

system binaries

service names

🔥 Most important files to review manually
Before sending to AI, quickly open:
authorized_keys_all_users.txt
proxy_env.txt
resolvectl_status.txt
nmcli_dev_show.txt
process_tree.txt
network_pid_intel.txt

✂️ Option 1 — Quick & Dirty Redaction (recommended)
We create a sanitized copy of the evidence.

Example script

SANITIZED="sanitized_bundle"
mkdir -p "$SANITIZED"

cp forensic_hunt_*/summary.txt "$SANITIZED" 2>/dev/null

for f in forensic_hunt_*/*.txt; do
  name=$(basename "$f")

  sed -E \
    -e 's/[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+/X.X.X.X/g' \
    -e 's/[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+/user@redacted/g' \
    -e 's#/home/[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+#/home/user#g' \
    -e 's/([Hh]ostname:).*/\1 REDACTED/g' \
    "$f" > "$SANITIZED/$name"
done

What this does
Replaces:
IPs → X.X.X.X
emails → user@redacted
/home/john → /home/user
hostnames → REDACTED

But preserves structure.

🧠 Option 2 — Light Redaction (SOC style)
If you want AI to correlate infrastructure, keep IPs but mask users.
Just remove the /home/* replacement.

🧠 Option 3 — Maximum paranoia mode
You can hash identifiers instead of replacing them.

Example:
john → user_8fa32
10.0.0.15 → ip_a91b
Keeps relationships without revealing data.

⚠️ Things you should NEVER upload
🚫 private SSH keys
🚫 VPN configs
🚫 password files
🚫 browser tokens
🚫 cloud credentials
Script doesn’t collect them, but always verify.

🧠 What professionals do
They create:
raw_evidence/
sanitized_evidence/

Raw → internal
Sanitized → vendors / AI / public sharing

🎯 Result
Now AI can analyze:

✔ patterns
✔ anomalies
✔ persistence
✔ stealth
without knowing who you are.
